For this course, we'll be building a simplified version of the financial dashboard that has:

- A public home page.
- A login page.
- Dashboard pages that are protected by authentication.
- The ability for users to add, edit, and delete invoices.

The dashboard will also have an accompanying database, which you'll set up in a later chapter.

By the end of the course, you'll have the essential skills needed to start building full-stack Next.js applications.
